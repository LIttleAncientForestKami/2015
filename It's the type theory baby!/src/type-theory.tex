        Propositions as Types is a notion with breadth. It applies to a
        range of logics including propositional, predicate,
        second-order, intuitionistic, classical, modal, and linear. It
        underpins the foundations of functional programming, explaining
        features including functions, records, variants, parametric
        polymorphism, data abstraction, continuations, linear types, and
        session types. (Wadler, Propositions as types)

        The presence of a static type system had a significant positive

        language required between 15 and 89 minutes less time for
        solving the task.

        We gave 27 subjects five programming tasks and found that the
        type systems had a significant impact on the development time:
        for three of five tasks me measured apositive impact of the
        static type system, for two tasks we measured a positive impact

        maintaining code written in two languages justified? Do we get
        any advantage out of combining two high-level, but quite
        different, languages?  As we try to show in this paper, in our
        experience the answer is affirmative, sometimes in non obvious
